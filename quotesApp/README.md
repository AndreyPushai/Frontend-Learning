Task:

Create a small web app that displays a random quote every time a button is clicked. This will help you understand arrays, functions, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
Steps:

    Set up a simple HTML page:
        Add a button that says "Get Quote".
        Add a section to display the quote.

    In your JavaScript:
        Create an array of quotes (each quote can just be a string).
        Write a function that selects a random quote from the array.
        Update the quote display area with the selected quote when the button is clicked.

    Extra:
        Add some styling using CSS to make it look nice.
        Add more functionality, like displaying the author's name along with the quote.

Example:

When the button is clicked, the app should display a random quote like:

    "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today." â€” Franklin D. Roosevelt

This task will help you get familiar with handling events, randomization, and working with arrays in JavaScript.
